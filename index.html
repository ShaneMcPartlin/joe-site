          <p><i>Joe has been studying, working, and performing in Chicago since 2013. While earning his degree in voice performance, he
          gained experience performing on university stages, orchestral halls, church pulpits, and street corners. Hei is equally
          comfortable as a stage orator and studio talent. Joe has cultivated a natural aptitude for dialect acquisition with
          several years of coachings. Since his graduation from Roosevelt University in 2018, Mr. Bierzynski has committed full
          time to a performance and recording career.</i></p>
